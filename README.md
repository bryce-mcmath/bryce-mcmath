### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack developer currently working for Maximus Canada as an Intermediate Application Developer, building and maintaining Vue and React apps with Node.js services written in TypeScript and JS. If you're a family member or friend that has come across this profile and are wondering what the heck that means, just imagine me as a plumber with thinner wrists. I even use something called AJAX!
